ANIMALS GIFS SEARCH ENGINE

This is a funny Animals GifS Search Engine destined for kids.

API
This application is powered by public API: GIPHY API.

APP LOGIC

When the app is displayed, the kids should be able to see already a gif of a funny lion.
This is the only gif not fetched from GIPHY API.
The children can search for a gif of one of 5 animals (monkey, lion, cat, dog or elephant).
In order to do so, the children only have to push a button with animal's image on it.
Each time the kids push the button, another random gif will be displayed.
Kids also have the option of pushing the surprise button.
This button serves to get a random animal from a set of animals provided (the 5 first animals listed above and also 4 more: bear, bird, squirrel and mouse).
If the kid choices to search for a surprise animal, the results will be displayed in form of stickers.
If the children click on the image of the current gif displayed, it will open a new tab with the same gif on GIPHY webpage.
